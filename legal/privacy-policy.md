# Privacy Policy

## Data collected when you access our website 

When you visit our website, or API service \([https://mraugu.xyz](https://mraugu.xyz/) or [https://docs.mraugu.xyz](https://docs.mraugu.xyz/) or [https://api.mraugu.xyz](https://api.mraugu.xyz/)\), Cloudflare, a service provider we use, sets an identification cookie that is used to make sure that you don't abuse or perform dangerous actions that might impair the availability of either services. This cookie is necessary to keep our website safe from automated  systems with malicious intentions. You can read more about what that cookie is and what it does more in detail below: [https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en us/articles/200170156 What does the Cloudflare cfduid cookie do](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-). However, if you don't wish to receive this cookie, you may use a "cookie blocker" although this may impair the functionality of the website and the user experience by giving you various challenge messages that you must complete to prove that you are not an automated system. Therefore the usage of such tools is at your discretion. In addition to this cookie, CloudFlare might save and use your data for analytical purposes, this includes, but it's not limited to: which URLs do you visit, what you or your browser downloads, where did request come from \(Country, IP address\) amongst others. We anonymize all analytical data, therefore we are not able to track a single user based on the data Cloudflare collects. On top of cloudflare's identification cookie, we also place a session identification cookie used for authentication.

## Data collected when you use our APIs

When you, as a user or an automated system, requests any of our APIs \(available at [https://api.mraugu.xyz/](https://api.mraugu.xyz/)\) we store the IP address, the User-Agent header, and the URL visited the API used \(name, version - if applicable, endpoint\), parts of the request response payload such as `statusCode`, `message`, as well as the internal ID and Discord ID of the account associated with the client application that queried the API. Statistical data is stored internally for an amount of 365 days after which our system will delete it automatically from any databases, by using our websites or APIs you automatically consent to this type of data collection. We also track usage of our service in general through access logs, which can contain the source IP address, user-agent and response times. The only time we allow the data to leave the servers is when we do a database backup. This data is necessary and enables us to monitor the usage of our service and give us time to react to spikes and the number of requests on a certain timeframe as well as protect our infrastructure from malicious users. We will never give your data to any 3rd party or sell it.

## Where is the data stored:

We store all of the collected data in an industry standard format with high security. At this point, we don't plan nor consider to have the data mentioned above on our platform ever to leave the EU or European economic zone.

## Data that we collect when you send us emails

When you write anything to our e-mail addresses \([support@mraugu.xyz](mailto:support@mraugu.xyz) or any other address ending with the domain [mraugu.xyz](https://mraugu.xyz/)\), we will store your e-mail for an indefinite amount of time. We will also keep all of the raw data of the conversation without asking for prior consent in order to improve our support service and to prevent any abuses from happening.
